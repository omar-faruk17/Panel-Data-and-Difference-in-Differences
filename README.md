# Project Overview

This project involves an applied practice of Panel Data and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodologies using two datasets provided in UCL SPP's PUBL0050 course.

**The datasets analyzed include:**

1. Refugees and Support for the Far Right – Dinas et al. (2018): Examines the impact of refugee arrivals on support for far-right parties in Greece.
2. Minimum Wages and Employment – Card and Krueger (1994): Investigates the effect of minimum wage increases on employment in fast-food restaurants.

The analysis applies Panel Data Regression and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) techniques to answer seminar questions related to these studies. 
I provided answers to the questions from the website based on these methods and datasets.
